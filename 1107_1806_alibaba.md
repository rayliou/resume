# Software Architect
**Type:** Permanent Full-time  
**Duration:** Jan 2016 - Jun 2018 (2 yrs 6 mos)

### Overview
My role focused on constructing a configurable, highly multiplexed, easy to understand, and deeply customizable data and model management system for Online Ads Machine Learning. This task involved handling data cleaning, processing, sample building, model management, and model delivery, each with its nuances and specific requirements.

### Key Activities and Achievements:
- **Machine Learning Data Lifecycle:** Designed the lifecycle, including Feature Extract, Instance Transform, Sample Build, Model Training (based on ODPS platform), Model Evaluation, and Model Delivery.
- **General Process Operators:** Implemented a wide range of operators using ODPS/Hadoop and Java.
- **Real-time AUC Feature:** Developed a fast, real-time AUC feature in TensorFlow utilizing C++ and Python.
- **Multi-version Model Delivery:** Achieved the capability for highly reliable, persistent, multi-version model delivery using Python/Java, Hadoop, ODPS, and Zookeeper.
- **DAG Pipeline Workflow:** Implemented N-generation of lightweight DAG pipeline workflows using Python and Hocon.

This initiative drastically reduced the time required for the lifecycle of model training and delivery from over 20 hours to just around 10 hours, significantly improving efficiency. Data scientists were able to adjust configurations and manage pipeline switches easily, streamlining the operational workflow.
