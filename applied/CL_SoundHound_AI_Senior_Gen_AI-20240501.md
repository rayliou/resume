**Dear Hiring Team,**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at SoundHound AI, given my background in C++ and machine learning optimization at Fluent.ai. There, I significantly improved machine learning algorithms for embedded systems, enhancing both computational efficiency and system responsivenessâ€”skills that align directly with the development of your conversational voice assistants.

My experience also includes developing a distributed advertising search engine at Alibaba Group and architecting SSL VPN systems at Beijing Topsec, where I focused on system-level programming and optimization. I am eager to leverage this expertise to contribute to SoundHound AI's innovative projects, enhancing voice AI interactions across your platforms.

**Best regards,** 
&nbsp;
