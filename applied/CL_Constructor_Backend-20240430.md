**Dear Hiring Team,**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am writing to express my interest in the Backend & API Engineer position at Constructor. My background as a Python developer, coupled with extensive experience in server-side coding, API design, and managing large-scale data processing systems, positions me as a strong candidate for this role.

My tenure at Alibaba Group involved leading the architecture of a high-traffic search engine system, which included daily management of nearly a hundred Hadoop clusters. This experience has honed my skills in designing systems that require high availability and robust data handling, directly aligning with the responsibilities of the Backend Engineer role at Constructor.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have a proven track record of integrating customer feedback into system improvements, ensuring that enhancements are both practical and user-centric. At Constructor, I am eager to apply this pragmatic approach to optimize your catalog management solutions and contribute to the team's success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my technical skills and experiences align with the needs of your team.

**Best regards,**
