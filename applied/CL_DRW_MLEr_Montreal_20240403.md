**Dear Hiring Team,
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Machine Learning Engineer position at your Montreal office. With a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and over a decade of experience in software development, particularly in C++ and Python within Linux environments, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to DRW's innovative projects.

My background includes extensive work with big data and distributed systems, leveraging Hadoop and Bash scripting to design and implement scalable solutions. This experience has equipped me with a deep understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts, as well as the technical proficiency required to build, validate, deploy, and monitor production models effectively.

At Fluent.ai, I optimized deep neural network models for DSP/MCU platforms, demonstrating my ability to enhance training and inference performance significantly. My hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, coupled with my strong problem-solving and analytical skills, make me well-prepared to design and implement scalable systems for serving machine learning models at DRW.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and interests align with the needs of DRW.
