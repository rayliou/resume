**Dear Hiring Team,
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am writing to express my interest in the Core Linux Developer position at Fivesky. With extensive experience in Linux, C++, and Python, complemented by my expertise in TCP/IP network protocols, I am eager to contribute to your team. My role at Beijing Topsec as a Software Architect, where I led SSL VPN architecture optimization, showcases my ability to enhance system performance and reliability, aligning with Fivesky's objectives.

My technical background is further supported by hands-on experience with Perl and a track record of developing high-performance solutions in regulated industries. At Fluent.ai and Alibaba Group, I successfully optimized machine learning models and large-scale data processing systems, demonstrating my proficiency in tackling complex technical challenges.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in a dynamic environment like Fivesky, where I can contribute to impactful technology solutions. My passion for continuous learning and problem-solving drives me to excel in fast-paced, innovative settings.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Fivesky's success.
