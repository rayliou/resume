Dear Hiring Manager,
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Full Stack AI/ML Developer position at Jesta I.S., as advertised. With a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Beijing Institute of Technology and over a decade of experience in software development, including significant expertise in AI/ML, large-scale data processing, and system optimization, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

During my tenure at Alibaba Group, I specialized in developing and managing large-scale data processing systems, notably utilizing Hadoop and Hive. This role involved the construction of a configurable, highly multiplexed data, and model management system for online ads machine learning, achieving remarkable efficiency improvements. My work reduced the lifecycle of model training and delivery from over 20 hours to around 10 hours, underlining my capacity to drive significant process optimizations.

In addition to my big data experience, I have developed analytical models using AI and ML techniques as a Machine Learning Systems Engineer at Fluent.ai. There, I optimized machine learning pipelines for large memory, single-machine scenarios, and applied advanced embedded inference techniques to DSP/MCU platforms. This cross-functional expertise positions me well to design, implement, and maintain scalable and efficient AI/ML applications.

I am proficient in Python, C++, Java, and have extensive experience with cloud environments, including AWS, which aligns with the technologies and languages you utilize. My background in deploying scalable AI models, data cleaning, and ensuring model accuracy through thorough validation strategies further matches the responsibilities outlined in the job description.

I am eager to bring my background in distributed systems, machine learning model optimization, and my proven ability to work autonomously to Jesta I.S. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my expertise in AI/ML development can drive value and innovation at your organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you.
