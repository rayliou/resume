**Dear Hiring Team,**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Embedded Software Engineer II - Telematics position at Samsara, as advertised. With over a decade of experience in software development, specifically with a strong background in C++, Linux, Python, and embedded systems, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to the Telematics firmware team.

At Fluent.ai, I honed my skills in machine learning and embedded system optimization, applying platform-specific instructions to enhance DSP/MCU platform feature extraction and neural network layers, significantly improving CPU efficiency and reducing memory usage. My role at BusPas Inc. further solidified my expertise in developing for Linux-based embedded systems, integrating Nvidia DeepStream to enable AI model support and predictions on IoT devices.

My tenure at Alibaba Group as a Senior Software Engineer and Software Architect allowed me to develop and ship production code for large-scale systems, focusing on real-time data updates and large-scale observability for production systems. These experiences have equipped me with the skills necessary to build and monitor metrics during firmware rollouts and assess incoming customer and QA found issues effectively.

I am particularly drawn to this role at Samsara because of its commitment to making vehicle fleets safer, greener, and more efficient through innovative telematics solutions. I am eager to bring my expertise in embedded software engineering, along with my passion for building scalable, impactful technologies, to Samsara's dynamic team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the needs of your team.
