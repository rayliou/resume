**Dear Hiring Team,**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I'm reaching out to apply for the Senior ML Infra Engineer role in the Detection Team. My background in MLOps, C++ machine learning model optimization, and embedded C++ development aligns well with the requirements listed for this position. With over 5 years of experience in developing data-oriented products and ML systems, particularly at Fluent.ai and Alibaba Group, I've honed my skills in Python, C++, Java, and key ML Ops technologies like Spark, Hadoop, Hive, along with ML training and serving platforms.

At Fluent.ai, my work involved enhancing TensorFlow & PyTorch training pipelines and optimizing DSP/MCU platform feature extraction, directly contributing to increased CPU efficiency and reduced memory use. My role at Alibaba Group further developed my expertise in managing complex distributed environments and implementing scalable solutions for machine learning model optimization.

I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my technical skills and experience to help Abnormal Security advance its mission of identifying and stopping email and cloud-based attacks. I look forward to contributing to the development of your Detection Engine's backend services and infrastructure.

Thank you for considering my application.
