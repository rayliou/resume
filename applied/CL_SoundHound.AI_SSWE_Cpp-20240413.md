**Dear Hiring Team,**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Software Engineer position at SoundHound AI, as advertised. With a robust background in software engineering, particularly in C++, Python, and machine learning, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to building advanced conversational voice assistants at your esteemed company.

My recent role as a Machine Learning Systems Engineer at Fluent.ai involved enhancing TensorFlow & PyTorch training pipelines and applying advanced inference techniques to DSP/MCU platforms using C++. These experiences have equipped me with the skills to optimize AI models and systems for high performance and efficiency, aligning perfectly with the needs of your Voice AI products.

Moreover, my tenure at Alibaba Group allowed me to significantly impact big data systems, utilizing Hadoop and Hive for real-time data processing and system optimizations. These projects not only honed my big data handling skills but also underscored my ability to manage and scale AI-powered technologies effectively.

I am particularly drawn to SoundHound AI's mission of making technology more interactive through natural language processing and AI, and I am eager to bring my background in machine learning, big data, and system architecture to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your innovative projects and support SoundHound AI in shaping the future of Voice AI interaction.
