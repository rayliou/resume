**Dear Hiring Team,**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am excited to apply for the Senior Data Engineer I - ML/AI position at Zinnia. My expertise in managing machine learning models and data engineering, combined with a proven track record in Python and machine learning deployment, positions me well to contribute effectively to your team.

In my current role at Fluent.ai, I have optimized TensorFlow & PyTorch training pipelines for improved performance. This role involved refining ML models for embedded systems, focusing on CPU efficiency and memory optimization using C++â€”a direct alignment with the responsibilities of the role at Zinnia.

At Alibaba Group, I managed machine learning pipelines using technologies similar to Apache Airflow on Alibaba Cloud, streamlining model delivery and service transitions using Python. This experience honed my skills in handling large-scale data applications and developing reliable ML solutions.

At BusPas Inc., I developed Docker-based IoT Edge solutions, implementing computer vision and smart power-saving features for embedded Linux IoT devices. This experience underscores my practical knowledge in deploying technology solutions in varied environments.

I am eager to bring my hands-on experience in ML pipeline management and embedded system optimization to Zinnia. I am particularly impressed by Zinnia's innovative approach to leveraging technology in the insurance industry and am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my application in further detail.
