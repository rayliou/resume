This summary incorporates your request for emphasis on distributed computing skills, specifically mentioning multi-threading, multi-processing, and shared memory, while also covering your expertise in network security and machine learning optimizations for embedded systems.



- 不对，网络安全部分不是分布式计算，而阿里巴巴的经验才是
- 去掉10年这种限定，不强调阿里巴巴，只是将广告搜索引擎C++核心开发， 加密，Linux，嵌入式，机器学习等都涉猎
- 机器学习的嵌入式优化没有涉猎？
- 分布式计算部分，可以说明多线程，多进程，共享内存等的熟练应用 最后将这个总结用英语输出
