## Work Experience
### Fluent.ai - Embedded C/C++ Machine Learning Optimization Engineer & Machine Learning Data Engineer
**Montreal, Quebec, Canada | Nov 2022 - Present**

Leveraging my hands-on experience in deep learning and C++ development, I efficiently ported our ultra-small deep learning models to various embedded hardware platforms. This involved optimizing algorithm logic, model precision, and platform-specific instructions, significantly improving CPU and memory utilization. My work also deepened my expertise in debugging techniques for embedded environments. Additionally, I enhanced our machine learning training pipelines using Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, enabling more effective GPU utilization.

### BusPas Inc. - Software Developer
**Montreal, Quebec, Canada | Jun 2022 - Nov 2022**

Led a team including interns to implement computer vision and power management functionalities using Python and Bash within a Docker environment based on Microsoft Azure IoT solutions. Successfully ported Nvidia pre-trained models to this IoT Docker environment using DeepStream.

### Gap Period: Family Reunion and Travel
**China,Canada and the Philippines | Jun 2018 - May 2022**

Traveled from China to Canada for a family reunion, followed by a leisure trip to the Philippines before returning to Canada.

### Alibaba Group - Software Development Specialist
**Beijing, China | Aug 2013 - Jun 2018**

As a long-standing architect and system administrator, I have continuously architected, designed, and led the development of large-scale advertising search engine systems, delivering index data and machine learning models daily and reliably. I iteratively evolved the technical framework from Streaming MapReduce to Hive, and then to Java MapReduce, transitioning from simple conditions to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflow engine, creating a configuration system friendly to data scientists. I also ensured reliable online service with timely data delivery, transmission, and seamless switching capabilities. Additionally, as an administrator of nearly a hundred Hadoop clusters, I was responsible for maintaining the daily operations of the clusters.

### Alibaba Group - Senior Software Engineer
**Beijing, China | Jul 2011 - Aug 2013**

Played a pivotal role in the development and optimization of an advertising search engine system, focusing on modifying index data structures and updating business logic using C++ and Java. Collaborated closely with the team to implement real-time data updates according to new advertising requirements and processed batch ads data and index building using Hadoop streaming (Perl/Bash/C++).

### Beijing Topsec Network Security Technology - Software Architect
**Beijing, China | Sep 2008 - Jul 2011**

Spearheaded the redesign of SSL VPN architecture at Topsec, implementing key enhancements such as three major proxies (web, port forward, tunnel), a customizable client portal, and CLI/Web management solutions. I conducted an in-depth study of Apacheâ€™s internal mechanisms to boost system functionality and designed an efficient AAA system, enhancing web traffic management using Apache filters and handlers in a C/C++ Linux environment. My efforts also included optimizing SSL cipher configurations and performing competitive product analysis to drive strategic enhancements.

## Education
**Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics**, Beijing Institute of Technology | 1997 - 2001
